    <div>Here is our recipe</div>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
         <li>400g All purpose flour</li>
        <li>3tbsp of butter</li>
        <li>1tbs baking powder</li>
        <li>100 - 150ml water</li>
        <li>1tbs of salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs (to make it richer)</li>
        <li>2tbsp of vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        <li>100g of sugar or honey whichever you prefer</li>
        <li>100ml milk (optional). I like my buns very rich &#128523</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Add all the dry ingredients with the butter in a bowl and mix to form crumble.</li>
        <li>Add the egg, milk, and water and mix to form a thick stretchy batter, <span>then add water to the flour in bits till you achieve the desired consistency. Do not overwork the batter.</span></li> 
        <li>Place a shallow pan on medium heat, add vegetable oil and allow to heat up till hot.</li>
        <li>By dropping in a small batter, test the oil for readiness. If the batter floats to the top, then it's ready.</li>
        <li>Carefully drop the batter in the hot oil in batches but don't overcrowd the oil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and fry the buns till golden brown and well done.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process until you have exhausted the whole batter mix.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <p><Strong>Note:</Strong> Always reduce the heat each time you are frying a new set then turn the heat back up to for even cooking. This way the buns doesn't turn brown quickly without cooking properly. Do this and thank me later.</p>
